# Spiderlink
Our game is type is endless run. basicly we just control our character, in this game our character is a spider. We have to get to the higher ground by casting a web and swing up. Every time we succeeded in reaching the higher ground, the screen refreshes and moving up the same way as our character does. When we fail to cast our web to the higher ground, our character will fall and it will result a game over.
